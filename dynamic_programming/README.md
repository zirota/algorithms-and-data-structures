# Dynamic Programming

## Tips & Tricks
### 1. Brute Force
* Start with simple inputs & draw out its tree
* Implement the tree with recursion using leaf nodes as base case
* Test with different inputs

### 2. Optimization
* Add an object for memoization (usually a HashMap of sorts)
* Add an additional base case at the start of the function to return memoized values
* Store the return value as a memoized value before returning it
