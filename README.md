# Algorithms & Data Structure

## Introduction
This repository contains my consolidated learnings while preparing for technical interviews mainly using TypeScript.

Each sub-folder focuses on the specific technique used for solving the technical problem. Each problem description is stored in its own file.

This repository is only useful only when there is a basic graps of data structures such as:

* Strings
* Arrays
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Tables
* Trees
* Linked List
* Tries
* Heaps
